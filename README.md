# StringReplace 1.0 by anic17

StringReplace 1.0 by anic17 is a function made to find a string in a file and then replace it by another one.

It supports all Unicode characters, except:
`! = ï¿½` (null character)

It is useful when you want to find a string, but as `find` and `findstr` doesn't have a function like that, I decided to code it myself.
